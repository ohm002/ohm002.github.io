This is an indie project made by me (with a support from Nanachi) and ran by ReactJS, PixiJS. Which is heavily inspired from NEOY2K aesthetics and projects such as Virtual Self and it's inspiration from it. This will only be a project that I'm making solely for fun. (and possibly for applying to university) The only benefits I  will expect to gain is my educational benefit.
