I'm actually not really Shiro.

I'm actually log(), or ohm002, the developer of this game.
I currently don't have any avatar so I'll just use his avatar for now.
But don't worry, he will have a role soon!

Hi, players! Thanks for trying out NEODITRONIX!
This has been a really tough thing to work on.
Making games has always been something I really want to achieve in my life, and now, It's kind of getting true now!
Now I think I should introduce you to the context of how this game is going to be developed.
$ICON=shiro2_smile
For now, I don't think I will call this a "game", as the main goal of this game is not to meant to satisfy you, rather it's to satisfy myself. 
It's made simply to test the limits on how far I can go in my creative endevours.

So that means, most of the songs in this game is going to be composed by me. (Unfortunately)
$ICON=shiro2_smile
Don't worry, there will definitely be songs from other artists to give you guys a fresh taste of new unique contents in this game.
$ICON=shiro2_confused
But according to what I planned.. At least the main story must only include my songs, that is my ground rule into developing this game.
$ICON=shiro2_smile
And.. Yeah! I think that's pretty much all about the context of how I will develop this game.
Thanks for taking a look at this Super Demo Beta Build, I'll see you on the full release!
