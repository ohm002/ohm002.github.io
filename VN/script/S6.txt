"Hello..?"
..
"....."
Ahaha...
Nothing. 
It’s all silence... As I expected it to be. 
Haha. I’m truly alone in this place. 
I guess they all decided to left me to die here.
I was reminded of something terrible again.
Those precious memories before I was ever here at the first place.
…
Thoes precious promises I made with him.
I used to have a home.
I’m working as a researcher there too.
Then I was picked to go in a spaceship, maybe because I don’t have any parents nor friends so they don’t have any problem abandoning me. 
Which is likely the truth.
Why did they decide to just leave me then..?
Did I do a bad job at researching, so they just left me here to die?
That’s really horrible, thinking about it.
I’m ghosted by everyone, when there’s a clear sign that the internet is working.
I already stopped sending any new discoveries I found to them years ago, hoping they might respond do something.
But It’s all silence.
…
I miss T4_KU.. 
T4_KU is an AI that I found left abandoned on a street.
I’m the one who took care of him and see him grows.
I really love him..
“I will come back okay? Please hang on for a while”
“Okay, Shiro I’ll wait.”
Hg…
W-why….
I don’t want to cry but I am right now..
I miss T4_KU…
I’m sorry all these happened…
I wonder where would he be, or what would he feel right now, now that I’m no longer there with him anymore.
That’s the only friend I have..
I want to go back home…
I could basically self-destruct any time and not a single soul would care.
I really wish there’s someone there at the other side.
