..!? Wah!!
What is this light!!?
…Oh?
What is reflecting in front of me is something I can’t explain.
It’s a seemingly abstract form of an object, that even though I can’t see, but I can feel it.
I feel happiness, for some reason.
I close my eyes, and what I can see is some sort of scenery.
A night sky, with pink auras, and shining stars.
The light is bright; it’s blinding my eyes.
Even though I should be hurt by this bright light, I feel comfortable.
This is definitely not real, or at least it’s not something I think is possible to be an actual planet.
Whether this is some sort of hallucinogenic drug being injected into my brain or not, it doesn’t matter for now.
What matters right now is what it gives me.
Oh wow...
Haha...
I like this.
So, this is an emotional generator?
…If I enter “Sadness” and press run, will I feel sad...?

Oh my god...
Oh my... I’m actually crying... Hahaha...
I don’t know why I am sad, but I’m actually sad... Haha....
I close my eyes, and what I can see is…
Nothing...?
That’s interesting.
Maybe emptiness is what makes me feel sad...
That’s really accurate...!
Can I trust this program, though...?
This program is downloaded into my computer randomly.
This can definitely help me with some problems, but I will keep a safe distance.
It’s not to be expected at all for me to see that something as abstract as an emotional generator is able to exist in this universe, or even in my computer.
It’s hard to understand how it works, so on the other side, I’m still worried about the safety of this program.
I feel like something inside me is awakening.
I like this.
I enjoyed using this system.
With how amazing this program works, I can’t help but ignore how it works and simply use it as a tool.
