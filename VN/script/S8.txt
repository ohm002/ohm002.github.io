[Calm d-down Shiro, If I die you know that the spaceship is not gonna continue working right!?!?]
[Please live on!!]
Yes I know.
Let’s die together.
I don’t want to live anymore.
I’ve lost everyone already.
T4_KU is gone.
My boss is gone.
My co-worker is gone.
They have decided to kill me now.
I have no chance at talking to them anymore.
And you’re quite possibility one of the worst fucking AI I’ve ever talked to.
Throughout these week.
You’re just setting there in your terminal.
Doing absolutely fucking nothing to help me.
Did you already forget that you’re my ASSISTANT!?

You’re not gonna feel pain.
Just die already.
