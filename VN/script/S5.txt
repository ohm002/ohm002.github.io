This is not a normal thing to happen naturally right..?
There shouldn’t be something this refined and polished if I was the only one alone here. 
I refused to believe this is some natural occurrence; for sure, it must mean something. 
My assumption is, there is indeed someone from another planet who makes this plate and sends it here. 
So I want to know if that assumption is true. 
If I believe that it will be true. Will it be as I wish? 
I guess it wasn't for me then.
After all, It was all just a jumbled mess of gibberish on every attempt. 
Haha...ha.
I hate it. 
I hate when this just keeps on giving me failed results. 
I just want to know that there’s a purpose inside this plate.
Can I even hold that hope now? A hope that I can see someone, someday. 
I just want to know that I’m not alone. 
Can you please tell me that this is someone else’s work and not some natural occurrences?
I still have some hope... 
As I think about how lonely I am in this place, I notice a small communications device on the lab's shelf. 
It appears to be working, but I can't hear any signals from outside. 
I pick up the device… 
Will there be any response if I decided to say something to it?
...I hope so.
