$CHAR=Shiro
1st attempt... Failed. 
So it was not this algorithm... 
I see. So what if I change this specific line of the algorithm? 
Will it show something meaningful? 
Beep! Boop! 
Beep! Boop! 
Beep Beep!
Nope... not at all. 
15th attempt... Failed. 
Damn... this is tough. 
30th attempt... Failed. 
70th attempt... Failed. 
100th attempt... Failed. 
500th attempt... Failed. 
700th attempt... Failed. 
For each and every attempt, Shiro’s gaze starts to be more intense and unhappy, as he’s trying his best to decode it.
