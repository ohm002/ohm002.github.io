Due to the radio silence, my curiosity heightened.
I simply use this program as an emotional support by now whenever I’m bored or sad.
I’m not overusing it though. I can generate good activities from it.
I just realized that I can make it generate some fun games for me to keep me being active.
It’s a fun tool for me to kill time.
It's fun for me to simply think about it.
$CHAR=
Beep!
Boop!
Beep! Boop!
Beep Beep!
$CHAR=Shiro
Ah! The results are out. 
$CHAR=
That is the sound of my lab machine, which is used to gather information about all the space objects I've collected.
I, Shiro, am a researcher. I have been one since the dawn of time. 
It is what gives me life, to know what I don’t know.
Isn’t it fascinating to see that there’s so much to know about this world? 
For sure, it’s better than knowing nothing at all.
Shiro walks into his lab room. 
The holograms displaying all the objects' data immediately launch up. 
This is the golden plate that he just found, and he wants to decode it.
1st attempt... Failed. 
$CHAR=Shiro
So it was not this algorithm... 
I see. So what if I change this specific line of the algorithm? 
Will it show something meaningful? 
$CHAR=Shiro
Beep! Boop! 
Beep! Boop! 
Beep Beep!
$CHAR=Shiro
Nope... not at all. 
$CHAR=
15th attempt... Failed. 
$CHAR=Shiro
Damn... this is tough. 
Frustration is normal, maybe the results will come into focus soon.
$CHAR=
30th attempt... Failed. 
$CHAR=Shiro
You see... 
$CHAR=
70th attempt... Failed. 
$CHAR=Shiro
At that time, I was so surprised by the carvings and all diagrams written on the plate. 
I simply started this because this is not a normal thing. 
$CHAR=
100th attempt... Failed. 
$CHAR=Shiro
There shouldn’t be something this refined and polished if I was the only one alone here. 
I refused to believe this is some natural occurrence; for sure, it must mean something. 
$CHAR=
500th attempt... Failed. 
$CHAR=Shiro
My assumption is, there is indeed someone from another planet who makes this plate and sends it here. 
So I want to know if that assumption is true. 
$CHAR=
700th attempt... Failed. 
$CHAR=Shiro
If I believe that it will be true. Will it be as I wish? 
$CHAR=
...
A while has passed. 
For what seems like an eternity to me, I stopped.
764th attempt at trying to decode this golden plate... Failed.
I guess it wasn't for me then.. 
$CHAR=Shiro
It was all just a jumbled mess of gibberish on every attempt. 
Haha...ha. 
I hate it. 
I hate when this just keeps on giving me failed results. 
I just want to know that there’s a purpose inside this plate.
Can I even hold that hope now? A hope that I can see someone, someday. 
I just want to know that I’m not alone. 
Can you please tell me that this is someone else’s work and not some natural occurrences?
I still have some hope... 
As I think about how lonely I am in this place, I notice a small communications device on the lab's shelf. 
It appears to be working, but I can't hear any signals from outside. 
I pick up the device… 
Will there be any response if I decided to say something to it?
...I hope so.
...
"Hello..?"
..
"....."
Ahaha...
Nothing. 
It’s all silence... As I expected it to be. 
Haha. I’m truly alone in this place. 
If only there’s someone to help me. Can I wish for someone to come here, please? 
I close my eyes, wishing for something to happen. 
Tears are running from my eyes. 
My second command line is opened. 
I opened that by myself.
This command line is basically my diary by now. 
If I could describe what you’ve always wanted in one phrase, what do I want to say? 
If I can describe it all like a song title..
