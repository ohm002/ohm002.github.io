Amidst the infinite universe, a single spaceship stood alone in the black void of space.
Inside the main operation room, a jumbled mess of nonsensical machines and countless computers seemed to be working as they should. 
Shiro opens his command line to check the log reports of the universe, as always.

Still nothing here... Jeez... 
Sometimes I’m really sick of getting empty logs like this. 
I’ve been receiving no signals for *weeks* now. 
Normally, I should get new information about the universe every few days, but now it's radio silent. 
That’s kinda weird. 
Theoretically, the universe must be infinite from my calculation, so I can never run out of something new to find. 
Have I not traveled far enough? 
At least I know that the closest planet I can go to for research is Earth. 
I guess I'll just lock in the planet and turn on autopilot mode.

Beep! Boop!

Oh...?
The sounds came from my computer.

“New system downloaded successfully.”
Even though I closed my internet, my computer was somehow still able to download something.
And it’s a... system..?
There’s a new system downloaded on my computer...?
What is this weird-looking system?
My curiosity immediately drags me towards the run button.
...Can I run it...?
