Amidst the infinite universe, a single spaceship stood alone in the black void of space.
Inside the main operation room, a jumbled mess of nonsensical machines and countless computers seemed to be working as they should. 
Shiro opens his command line to see any messages from his boss, as always.

Still nothing here... Jeez... 
Sometimes I’m really sick of getting empty msgs like this. 
I’ve been receiving no messages for years now. 
I’m starting to think that they completely just abandoned me.
I’m alone..
I wish they at least respond to me.
Mister AI
Is there is possibility for any new discoveries here?
[ I did found something in 0.12 radian 4.56LY, it seems to have some circle objects there. Would you like me to bring you there?]
Oh, sure thing.
That was an AI that my boss wrote it for me to assists me during the research.
He’s alright, he’s pretty fun sometimes.
But T4_KU is obviously so much better.
