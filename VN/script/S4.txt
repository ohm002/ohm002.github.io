A while has passed. 
For what seems like an eternity to me, I stopped.
1000th attempt at trying to decode this golden plate... Failed.
Fuck this thing, I’ll just go back to what my usual life is.
Uggghghhh….. I’m so tired of this.
Mister AI~~
Can you please decode this thing for me~~
I’m already so tired of doing this, so I asked Mister AI instead.
[I’m sorry Shiro, I have also tried every single cipher stored in your database but none showed a successful result.]
Oh, not even an AI can fix this shit too.
This AI is pretty useless… Wow..
Damn..
Mannn…
Ok then, I’ll just have some coffee.
I’ll throw all these away later then.
