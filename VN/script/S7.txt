He’s now, still, laying on the old couch.
The main room is ruined, There’s garbage everywhere.
The smell of the coffee is overwhelming.
Nothing about this place is pleasing anymore.
He seems really scary to talk to right now.
So I didn’t answer any of his question.
I’m too scared to talk to him.
This happened so many times before. 
And the worst thing I would like to see happen is him spiraling down even more.

Shiro’s slow gaze into his computer.
Written there was..
That was probably something Shiro would never wanted to see ever in his life.
At the corner of his screen reads.
“INTERNET DISCONNECTED”
Mister AI’s eyes widen in shock as he knows exactly what happened.
This is definitely the end for him.
His eyes is still emotionless and tired.
He finally gets up and walks to the computer.
